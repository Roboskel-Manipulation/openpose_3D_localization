# keypoint_3d_matching

# Description
Receives the OpenPose output (2D pixels) of the keypoints of interest and returns the 3D coordinates of the point expressed in the `camera_rgb_optical_frame`. 

- src/keypoint_3d_matching.cpp: Main functionality for the 3D matching
- src/functions: Helful functions utilized by keypoint_3d_matching.cpp
- config/keypoint_3d_matching.yaml: Parameters used by the keypoint_3d_matching ROS node
- include/keypoint_3d_matching.h: Header files and variable declarations
- launch/keypoint_3d_matching.launch: Launch file for keypoint_3d_matching ROS node

# Run
- In config/keypoint_3d_matching.yaml specify the points of interest based on include/keypoint_3d_matching.h
- In a terminal run `roslaunch keypoint_3d_matching keypoint_3d_matching.launch`


## Scripts

_scripts/_ folder includes a collection of scripts that can help us evaluate the performance of our "Human Body as an Obstacle" software pipeline.
* **evaluate_pose_estimation.py** and **process_output.py** process the contents of the log files that can be generated by setting ```logging: true``` at the *./openpose_ros_receiver/config/openpose_ros_receiver.yaml* configuration file.
* **extract_trajectories.py** processes the json output that the openpose_ros wrapper can produce by setting the ```write_json``` flag of the *openpose_ros/openpose_ros/src/gflags_options.cpp* to point to the desired path.
