# keypoint_3d_matching

Receives the OpenPose output (2D pixels) of the keypoints of interest and returns the 3D coordinates of the point expressed
in the `camera_rgb_optical_frame`. 

In the config file, the keypoints of interese can be specified as a list of integers, each corresponding to a keypoint.
The mapping is based on this mapping (https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/src/openpose/pose/poseParameters.cpp)


## Scripts

_scripts/_ folder includes a collection of scripts that can help us evaluate the performance of our "Human Body as an Obstacle" software pipeline.
* **evaluate_pose_estimation.py** and **process_output.py** process the contents of the log files that can be generated by setting ```logging: true``` at the *./openpose_ros_receiver/config/openpose_ros_receiver.yaml* configuration file.
* **extract_trajectories.py** processes the json output that the openpose_ros wrapper can produce by setting the ```write_json``` flag of the *openpose_ros/openpose_ros/src/gflags_options.cpp* to point to the desired path.
