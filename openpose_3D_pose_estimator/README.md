# openpose_ros_receiver

Receive the OpenPose output's skeletons and transform their keypoints coordinates from the camera coordinate frame to the robot coordinate frame.

## Important Note

This software is a product of on-going research and has been developed and tested with only one human in the robot workspace environment. Its adaptation for an environment with multiple humans is left open for future research.

```

## Scripts

_scripts/_ folder includes a collection of scripts that can help us evaluate the performance of our "Human Body as an Obstacle" software pipeline.
* **evaluate_pose_estimation.py** and **process_output.py** process the contents of the log files that can be generated by setting ```logging: true``` at the *./openpose_ros_receiver/config/openpose_ros_receiver.yaml* configuration file.
* **extract_trajectories.py** processes the json output that the openpose_ros wrapper can produce by setting the ```write_json``` flag of the *openpose_ros/openpose_ros/src/gflags_options.cpp* to point to the desired path.
